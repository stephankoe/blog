title: "Machine Learning"
description: "Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses algorithms and statistical models to create self-learning computer programs for automated recognition, generation and prediction tasks. Instead of being explicitly programmed, these models independently derive these capabilities from real-world and/or synthetic datasets. ML algorithms can be further classified into supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised algorithms."
