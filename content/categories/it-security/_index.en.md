# IT Security

IT security, or information security, encompasses ensuring the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information systems through technical or non-technical methods. Commonly used technical methods in this context include, for example:

- the encryption of data (confidentiality),
- effective access and rights controls (integrity, e.g., through firewalls, but also user accounts), or
- the use of redundant systems (availability).

Examples for non-technical methods are

- regular security audits,
- the physical isolation of IT devices incl. effective access controls, or
- protocols to respond to security incidents promptly.

A seamless security is usually difficult to achieve with IT systems. Therefore, the goal in information security is to reduce the expected risk to an acceptable minimum through economically appropriate measures.
